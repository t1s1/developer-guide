= Quick course content format guide

The structure of the course is organized as a hierarchy, so it's helpful to think of the content in terms of chapters, or modules, and then pages, or sections.

At the top level (course), the antora.yml file defines the overall structure. It  has the course title and the links to `nav.adoc` files in each module (aka chapter - they are the same thing here).

[source]
----
name: course
title: Course Title
version: 1
nav:
- modules/ch1/nav.adoc
- modules/ch2/nav.adoc
- modules/ch3/nav.adoc
----

It may be clear at this point that we need a `modules` directory, with each module/chapter as a sub-directory. They do not need to be labeled ch1, ch2, etc, but their labels would need to appear in the above antora file.

Each module/chapter directory should have a 'nav.adoc' file with the following syntax:

[source]
----
* xref:index.adoc[]
** xref:section1.adoc[]
** xref:section2.adoc[]
----

This is the listing of the adoc files that actually contain the content. These should be placed in a `pages` directory. Any images that need to be referenced go into an `images` directory at the same level as `pages` and the 'nav.adoc' file referenced above. 

See xref:references:asciidocqrg.adoc[Asciidoc quick reference guide] for help with drafting of your content.
